# A-SCALABLE-YOLOV12-APPROACH-TO-POTHOLE-DETECTION-IN-URBAN-ROADWAYS
Potholes are one of the most common causes of road accidents and vehicle damage, posing a serious challenge to urban infrastructure maintenance and transportation safety. Manual detection methods are inefficient, time-consuming, and often inaccurate. This project proposes an automated, AI-driven pothole detection system using the YOLOv12 (You Only Look Once, Version 12) object detection algorithm. By analyzing road images and video streams in real-time, the system accurately detects and highlights potholes, enabling faster and more effective maintenance response. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of road images and integrated into a lightweight pipeline suitable for deployment on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano. Additionally, features like distance estimation and audio alerts enhance real-time usability for drivers. This scalable solution lays the groundwork for smart city applications by improving road safety, optimizing repair planning, and supporting autonomous infrastructure monitoring.
